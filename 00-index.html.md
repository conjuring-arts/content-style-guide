This style guide was created for Headmaster employees, but we hope it’s helpful for other content and communications teams too.

## If you work at Headmaster

This is our company style guide; which is heavily based on [Mailchimp's Content Style Guide](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com). It helps us write clear and consistent content across teams and channels. Please use it as a reference when you’re writing for Headmaster.

This guide goes beyond basic grammar and style points. It’s not traditional in format or content. We break a number of grammar rules for clarity, practicality, or preference.

We’ve divided the guide by topic based on the types of content we publish, so you can reference it as needed or browse in order. The entire guide is searchable, so you can go straight to the item you’re looking for.

## If you work at another organization

We invite you to use and adapt this style guide as you see fit. It’s completely public and available under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International license. All we ask is that you credit Mailchimp and Headmaster.

We welcome any feedback for improving the guide.
